## 🧪 How to Test Current Implementation

### 1. Check Push Token

When you open the app, check the console:

```
✅ Notification permissions granted
📱 Expo Push Token: ExponentPushToken[xxxxx]
✅ Push token received: ExponentPushToken[xxxxx]
📝 Storing push token for user: [userId]
```

### 2. Send Test Notification

Add this to any screen (temporarily):

```typescript
import { sendTestNotification } from '../src/hooks/useNotifications';

// In a button handler:
await sendTestNotification(
  'Test Notification',
  'This is a test from GinMai!',
  { test: true }
);
```

### 3. Test Real Push Notification

Use the Expo push notification tool:
https://expo.dev/notifications

Paste your push token and send a test notification.
